<h1>The Best Movie According To Chitransh</h1>

<h2>My favourite top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1.RRR</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie.<br />
   All about the Worriers.</p>

<h3>2.Drishyam</h3>
    <p>
     The movie clearly clarifies and differentiates what is 'Right' and<br />
    'wrong' and shows us that for the righteous cause one should be<br />
     willing to do anything and to go any length.

    whose bravery and unflinching courge in chasing the Pakistani<br />
    soldiers out of India finally winning the Kargil War in 1999.</p>
